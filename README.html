<h1 id="carrotcakewmaplecreamcheesefrosting">Carrot Cake w/ Maple Cream Cheese Frosting</h1>

<p>This is my wife&#8217;s favorite recipe for cupcakes. Personally, I&#8217;m not a fan of cream cheese frosting, but these are tasty. She makes them without the rasins per my request because, c&#8217;mon&#8230; rasins ruin every dessert.</p>
