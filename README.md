Carrot Cake w/ Maple Cream Cheese Frosting
==========================================

This is my wife's favorite recipe for cupcakes. Personally, I'm not a fan of cream cheese frosting, but these are tasty. She makes them without the rasins per my request because, c'mon... rasins ruin every dessert.
